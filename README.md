# POS Malaysia Mobile Application Modification Project

This repository contains an **academic project** (BIS2102 – Information Systems Analysis & Design, Sunway University, 2024).  
Our team redesigned the POS Malaysia mobile application to address key user frustrations and security issues.

## 📌 Project Overview
The original POS Malaysia app had three main problems:
1. **Troublesome account verification** (camera-based ID scanning often failed)
2. **Inaccurate rate calculator** (no location or parcel dimension filters)
3. **Limited profile management** (difficult to change password, update profile picture, or delete account)

✅ Our enhanced app introduced:
- **OTP Authentication** for faster and more secure login   
- **Improved Rate Calculator** with location and dimension filters
- **Streamlined Account Management** accessible directly from the home page
